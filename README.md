------------------

MitreLlama is a tool designed to analyze incoming traffic against MITRE ATLAS and MITRE ATT&CK data using local or remote Large Language Models (LLMs). This project aims to unify the powerful libraries with an agentic response framework to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

- **Traffic Analysis**: Utilize LLMs to scrutinize incoming traffic.
- **MITRE Integration**: Cross-reference traffic patterns with MITRE ATLAS and MITRE ATT&CK databases.
- **Agentic Response**: Automatically generate agentic responses based on identified threats.
- **Local & Remote Models**: Flexibility to use either local or cloud-hosted LLMs.

## üìö Background

MitreLlama leverages the comprehensive adversarial tactics and techniques databases from MITRE to provide robust AI security measures. MITRE ATLAS and MITRE ATT&CK are pivotal frameworks for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in AI systems, offering detailed adversarial techniques and real-world case studies.

## üåê Use Cases

- **Threat Detection**: Identify and mitigate threats before they can exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure AI systems comply with standards like GDPR by identifying security gaps.
- **Risk Management**: Proactively manage risks by understanding potential threats.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
